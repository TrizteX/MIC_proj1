# MIC Project 1: Contribution to PyVision
# WGAN

## This is a PyTorch 1.5.0 implementation of WGAN 
## Requirements: 
1. Python 3.5+ 
2. Numpy 1.18.5
3. PyTorch 1.5+
4. Gdown 3.11.0
5. Matplotlib 3.2.1

## Dataset
CelebA was used for the training of this model, [link to CelebA!](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). 
If you wish to use your own dataset, the structure should be "datasets/sub_dir/img.png". The dataset will download as a file named img_align_celeba.zip. Once downloaded, create a directory named celeba and extract the zip file into that directory. Then, set the dataroot input for this notebook to the celeba directory you just created. The resulting directory structure should be: "/path/subdir/img.png"

This is an important step because we will be using the ImageFolder dataset class, which requires there to be subdirectories in the datasetâ€™s root folder.

## Train
To train on your own dataset:
1. Specify dataset path in wgan.py " dataroot = 'path' " line 44
2. You can change other parameters such as batch_size, etc but we suggest to use the ones already provided
3. Please change the number of workers defined in wgan.py " workers = " line 49. 
4. More parameters regarding training length, learning rate, etc can be changed in train.py, starting line 178

## Inference
To run inference on the trained model:
### Weights from a pretrained model on CelebA will automatically downloaded if not specified elsewise.
In order to run inference on your own trained model:
1. Change set_ckpt_dir in inference.py
2. You can change the number of images generated by changing the "len" parameter in inference.py, line 57
